# If you'd like to add missing compatability across mods, take a look at the mod's source and make a fork!


<i> Inspired by <a href="https://ficsit.app/mod/MinimalFactory" >[Minimal Factory]</a>, We have recreated the mod for U6+ with no dependencies. Save your FPS and a headache by turning that assembly line of one hundred smelters, to **ONE** with the **output** of **one hundred**.</i>

#### Features:
* `x10, x100` <span style="color:#FFA500;"> versions of vanilla machines. </span>
* `x4, x16, x64` <span style="color:#FFA500;"> versions of vanilla machines. </span>
* <span style="color:#FFA500;"> Multiplayer compatible </span>
* <span style="color:#FFA500;"> Compressed liquids for Generator outputs to accommodate pipe throughput limits. </span>

#### How It Works:
As new machines are unlocked in game, 2 new schematics become available to unlock.
* <span style="color:#FFA500;"> One unlocks the </span> `x10 and x100` <span style="color:#FFA500;"> versions of the vanilla machines. </span>
* <span style="color:#FFA500;"> One unlocks the </span> `x4, x16, and x64` <span style="color:#FFA500;"> versions of the vanilla machines. </span>

They can be unlocked independently from each other. If you find your build menu a bit cluttered by the unlocks we recommend  <a href="https://ficsit.app/mod/BuildMenu
" >[Build Menu Organizer]</a> which has options to configure your menus to your liking.
We would also recommend the addition of some form of conveyor belt and miner/extractor mods to increase throughput; as with Compact Machines, your output can quickly exceed vanilla throughput limits.

###### <span style="color:#FF0000;"> Known problems: </span>
* Particle Accelerator power usage is unchanged.
  * <i> This is because internally each Particle Accelerator recipe has a different power usage. So you cannot globally edit the power consumption. </i> <span style="color:#ddee00;"> [Low Priority] </span>
* Chance of small math error in startup and cooldown times of machines; Does not appear to affect gameplay. <span style="color:#ddee00;"> [Low Priority] </span>

###### <span style="color:#009EE3;"> Potential Updates: </span>
* Liquid Compressor - Compress liquids to accommodate more than `6m`<sup>3</sup>  of compressed liquid per production cycle of machines.
* Edit some recipes for Refinery and Blender to accommodate  higher throughput of compressed liquid versions of recipes. <br>[Most recipes will work fine with the `x4, x10` versions of recipes.]
